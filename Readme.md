# Flappy Bird AI Agent

This project uses the NEAT algorithm to train an AI agent to play Flappy Bird using Python and Pygame.

## Features

- **Trainable AI Agent**: Uses NEAT for evolving neural networks.
- **Trained Model**: Replay the best trained model with `Trained_flappy_Neat.py`.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Observe the AI learn and play.

## Project Structure

- `Flappy_Neat.py`: Code for training the AI agent using NEAT.
- `Trained_flappy_Neat.py`: Code for running the trained agent.
- `main.py`: Basic game logic.
- `Neat_Config.txt`: NEAT configuration.
- `best_flappy_bird.pkl`: Saved best-performing AI agent.
- All assets...
